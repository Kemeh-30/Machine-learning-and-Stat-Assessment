CHI-SQUARED QUESTION 2

This code is designed to analyze the association between two categorical variables (drink preference and biscuit preference) using the chi-squared test and provides key statistics for interpretation.


In this question the first thing i did was to import Libararies
In the first two lines, the code imports necessary libraries:
numpy (imported as np): A library for numerical operations in Python.
chi2_contingency from scipy.stats: A function specifically for performing the chi-squared test for independence.

observed = np.array,The code creates a 2D NumPy array named observed to represent the observed counts in a contingency table. In this case, it's a 2x2 table representing the counts of respondents based on their drink preference (coffee or tea) and biscuit preference (chocolate or plain).

The chi2_contingency function is used to perform the chi-squared test. It takes the observed counts as input and returns four values:
chi2: The chi-squared test statistic.
p: The p-value of the test.
dof: Degrees of freedom.
expected: The expected frequencies, which are the counts you would expect in each cell if there were no association.

The code then prints out the results of the chi-squared test:




Explanation for the PCA (QUESTION 5 CODE)

purpose of the PCA analysis and THE  interpretation of  the results:

Purpose of PCA:

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA is used to reduce the number of dimensions (features) in a dataset while preserving the most important information.
Decorrelation: PCA transforms the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.
Variance Retention: The first few principal components capture the majority of the variance in the data, allowing us to retain most of the information with fewer features.


Results and Interpretation:

Visualization: The scatter plot visualizes the Iris dataset in the space of the first two principal components. Each point represents an observation (flower), and the color indicates its species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

Separation of Classes: If the classes are well-separated in the new two-dimensional space, it suggests that the principal components effectively capture the variation that distinguishes different species.

Interpretation: Observations that are close in the plot are similar in terms of their principal components, indicating similarity in the original high-dimensional feature space.

By examining the scatter plot, one can assess how well the two principal components separate the classes in the Iris dataset. If the classes are distinct, it indicates that the two principal components retain enough information to discriminate between different species. This visualization can be valuable for understanding the inherent structure of the dataset and may be useful for subsequent classification tasks.
