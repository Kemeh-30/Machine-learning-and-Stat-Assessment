CHI-SQUARED QUESTION 2

This code is designed to analyze the association between two categorical variables (drink preference and biscuit preference) using the chi-squared test and provides key statistics for interpretation.


In this question the first thing i did was to import Libararies
In the first two lines, the code imports necessary libraries:
numpy (imported as np): A library for numerical operations in Python.
chi2_contingency from scipy.stats: A function specifically for performing the chi-squared test for independence.

observed = np.array,The code creates a 2D NumPy array named observed to represent the observed counts in a contingency table. In this case, it's a 2x2 table representing the counts of respondents based on their drink preference (coffee or tea) and biscuit preference (chocolate or plain).

The chi2_contingency function is used to perform the chi-squared test. It takes the observed counts as input and returns four values:
chi2: The chi-squared test statistic.
p: The p-value of the test.
dof: Degrees of freedom.
expected: The expected frequencies, which are the counts you would expect in each cell if there were no association.

The code then prints out the results of the chi-squared test:
