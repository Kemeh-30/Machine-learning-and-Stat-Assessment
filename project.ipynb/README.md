Iris Flower Classification Project
Overview
This project explores the well-known Iris Flower dataset associated with Ronald A. Fisher. The primary goal is to classify iris flowers into different species using a Decision Tree Classifier. The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

Contents
Notebook: Jupyter notebook (iris_classification.ipynb) containing the entire analysis, code, and visualizations.
Data: The Iris dataset is included in the scikit-learn library.
Readme: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for use.

How to Use

git clone  https://github.com/Kemeh-30/Machine-learning-and-Stat-Assessment.git

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook projectiris.ipynb

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.


Results
The Decision Tree Classifier achieved an accuracy of 1.0
Visualizations provide insights into the features influencing classification decisions.
Conclusion
The analysis lays the groundwork for understanding the Iris dataset and demonstrates the application of a Decision Tree Classifier. Further exploration and experimentation with different algorithms are encouraged.
